<h4>Hiding Scrollbars on Windows machines</h4><p>After adding <code>vw</code>, you probably saw that the scrollbars appeared in case you are working on Windows.This happens as using <code>vw</code> on Windows does not includethe scrollbars - <code>vw: 100</code>is equal to 100% of the viewport width+ the scrollbars. On the Mac this is not an issue, but when using Windows it is as the scrollbars are displayed by default.</p><p>In case you don't want to display these scrollbars, you can use one of these solutions:</p><p>- Use <code>width: 100%</code>instead of <code>vw: 100</code></p><p>- Add<code>overflow-x: hidden;</code> to the<code>body</code>selector in the shared.css file to hide the horizontal scrollbar (or <code>overflow-y: hidden</code> to hide the vertical scrollbar)</p><p>Alternatively you could alsouse the<code>::-webkit-scrollbar</code>pseudo element. Simply add the following code to the shared.css file:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">body: :-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 0
}
</pre><p>To make sure this works correctly on different browsers, you have to add additional code to it.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180505112131/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/kurlak/2013/11/03/hiding-vertical-scrollbars-with-pure-css-in-chrome-ie-6-firefox-opera-and-safari/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This blog post</a>nicely summarizes all the code needed right here.</p><p>Make sure to follow these approaches in case you don't want to display the scrollbars on Windows machines.</p>
