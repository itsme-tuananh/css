<h4>Flexbox and the Z-Index</h4>

<p>In the position module we learned that adding the <code>z-index</code>to an element only has an effect, if the<code>position</code> property with a value different from <code>static</code> wasapplied to this element.</p>











<p>One exception from this behaviour is flexbox: Applying the <code>z-index</code> toflex-items (so the elements inside of the flex-container)will change the order of these items even if no <code>position</code> property was applied.</p>











<p>You will need the <code>z-index</code> for flex-items in the followingassignment, so keep that specialbehaviour in mind.</p>
