<p>There's a tiny error in the web page - one link is broken.</p><p>On the "Customers"page (=&gt;<code>index.html</code>in the "customers" folder), there is a link which leads into the void. The "Start Hosting"link should point to <code>"../start-hosting/index.html"</code>.</p><p>We'll also fix it together in a later video but feel free doing that right now already.</p>
