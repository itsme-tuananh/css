<p>We had a look at <code>display: none;</code>&nbsp; - this value removes the element to which you apply it from the document flow. This means that the element is&nbsp;not visible and it also doesn't "block its position". Other elements can&nbsp;(and will)&nbsp;take its place instead.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to that though.</p>





















<p>If you only want to hide an element but you want to keep its place (i.e. other elements don't fill the empty spot), you can use <code>visibility: hidden;</code>&nbsp;</p>





















<p>Here's a visual example:</p>





















<pre class="prettyprint linenums">.box-1 {
    display: none;
}

.box-2 {
    display: inline-block;
}</pre>































<p>Will render:</p>















<p><code>x</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>













<p>where <code>x</code>&nbsp; has the class <code>box-2</code>&nbsp;. The first element just isn't displayed. <strong>It's still part of the DOM&nbsp;though</strong>, you can still access it via JavaScript for example.</p>















<p>Here's an example for <code>visibility: hidden</code>&nbsp;:</p>















<pre class="prettyprint linenums">.box-1 {
    visibility: hidden;
}

.box-2 {
    display: inline-block;
}</pre>



















<p>Will render:</p>







<p><code>_x</code>&nbsp;</p>







<p>where <code>_</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;simply is an empty spot and <code>x</code>&nbsp; has the class <code>box-2</code>&nbsp;.</p><p>The element is only invisible, <strong>it's not removed from the document flow and of course also not from the DOM.</strong></p>
